Autonomous moving robot

First I went through the Python tutorials and learnt how to use google colab for coding.
Next I installed Github and went through its tutorial.
Then I started the Google ML course in which I learnt the basics of ML, such as Regression, Classification, Neural Netwroks and how to train them.
Thereafter I went through the OpenCV tutorial in which I learnt about the various functions present in OpenCV for Computer vision, such as Contour, Edge, and Face detection through Python.
I completed the TensorFLow tutorials using Python, the CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) lectures, and learnt how to implement Lane Detection using OpenCV. Now, I started the ROS and Gazebo tutorials after which I will begin the final implementation of the project using all the resources I have learnt about.
