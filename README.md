# SOC
Autonomous moving robot

First I went through the Python tutorials and learnt how to use google colab for coding.
Next I installed Github and went through its tutorial.
Then I started the Google ML course in which I learnt the basics of ML, such as Regression, Classification, Neural Netwroks and how to train them.
Thereafter I went through the OpenCV tutorial in which I learnt about the various functions present in OpenCV for Computer vision, such as Contour, Edge, and Face detection through Python.
I will now be going through the TensorFlow tutorials.
